# Create a plugin

<Steps>
### Create an object
```js copy filename="my-plugin.js"
const myPlugin = {
    // Your code will go here.
}
```

### Name it
```js copy filename="my-plugin.js"
const myPlugin = {
    name: 'your-plugin-name'
}
```

### Set the Initialize function
```js copy filename="my-plugin.js"
const myPlugin = {
    name: 'your-plugin-name',
    init: (api) => {
        // Code that you want to execute only once, the first time the turtle.enable function is called
        // 'api' can help you access all properties in the turtle class, just like 'this' in the turtle class
        console.log(api._plugins)
    }
}
```

### Set the Execute function
```js copy filename="my-plugin.js"
const myPlugin = {
    name: 'your-plugin-name',
    init: (api) => {
        // Code that you want to execute only once, the first time the turtle.enable function is called.
        // 'api' can help you access all properties in the turtle class, just like 'this' in the turtle class.
        console.log(api._plugins);
    },
    execute: (api) => {
        // Code that you want to execute when a new frame is drawn.
        // 'api' is the same as in the initialize function.
        console.log(api.animateDatas);
    }
}
```

### Options
- `zIndex` : If you want to draw, it can help you control the order of plug-in execution to control the upper and lower layers of graphics.

### Export
```js copy filename="my-plugin.js"
const myPlugin = {
    name: 'your-plugin-name',
    init: (api) => {
        // Code that you want to execute only once, the first time the turtle.enable function is called.
        // 'api' can help you access all properties in the turtle class, just like 'this' in the turtle class.
        console.log(api._plugins);
    },
    execute: (api) => {
        // Code that you want to execute when a new frame is drawn.
        // 'api' is the same as in the initialize function.
        console.log(api.animateDatas);
    }
}

export default myPlugin;
```

### Use the plugin
```js copy filename="main.js"
import myPlugin from 'my-plugin.js';

// ...

t.register(myPlugin);
t.enable('your-plugin-name');
```
